## Description
A simple to use and free C++20 library for Reed-Solomon Error Correction (encoding and decoding). The static library provides very easy integration in your projects and high speeds. CMake build environment is supported, as well as generating projects for VisualStudio or Xcode.
Also included is a small DataChunker class, to split up large data sets into smaller pieces, which can be individually encoded, decoded and assembled again.
